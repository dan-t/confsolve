Runtime Options:
   (T)ake File (NUM) => By pressing 't' and a number (e.g 't1'), the conflicting file with the
                        number NUM is used as the new version. A copy of the
                        current file and the other conflicting files is put
                        into the trash directory 'FilePath "~/.confsolve/trash"'.

   (M)ove to Trash   => By pressing 'm', all conflicting files are
                        moved into the trash directory 'FilePath "~/.confsolve/trash"'.

   Show (D)iff (NUM) => By pressing 'd' and a number (e.g 'd1'), the difference between the
                        current file and the conflicting file NUM is shown.
                        If there's only one conflicting file, then only pressing
                        'd' is sufficient.
                        By pressing 'd' and two numbers (e.g 'd1 2'), the difference between
                        the two conflicting files is shown.
                        The diff tool can be specified by the user by setting the environment
                        variable 'CONFSOLVE_DIFF'. The default diff tool is 'gvimdiff -f'.

   (S)kip            => By pressing 's', the current conflict is skipped
                        and the next one is shown.

   (Q)uit            => By pressing 'q', the application is quit.

   (H)elp            => By pressing 'h', this help is printed.
